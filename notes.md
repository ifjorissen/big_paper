# Notes For the Big Paper
@ifjorissen

#### Fall break 2015
  * Installed Voro++, Triangle, QHull
  * Learn / Refresh C: [http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/]
  * Cloned (& installed via brew) CGAL
  * Played around with a couple of the basic examples with Voro++ and installed gnuplot to view output (see Voro++/examples/basics/README)
  * Installed some (seemingly random) profiling tools for c/c++
    * `brew install qcahegrind --with-graphviz`
    * `brew install --HEAD valgrind`
    * To do: have a gander at [https://kusemanohar.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/c-performance-analysis-profiling-tools/]
    * To do: need to install XCode Tools & use Instrument

#####Week of 10.26.15
  * 1:37pm: Trying to get QHull up and running. the `make` command is failing.
  * Changed a line in the makefile:
    * `bin/testqset_r: src/testqset_r/testqset_r.o src/libqhull_r/qset_r.o src/libqhull_r/mem_r.o src/libqhull/usermem_r.o
  $(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CC_OPTS2) -lm` --> `bin/testqset_r: src/testqset_r/testqset_r.o src/libqhull_r/qset_r.o src/libqhull_r/mem_r.o src/libqhull_r/usermem_r.o
  $(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CC_OPTS2) -lm`
  * `make` now runs but exits with some errors...
  * 2:18pm: made problem size samples with bounding box of 100 with Qhull's rbox. Saved in analysis/data

  * 10.29.15@2:28pm: Realized the voro++ computes 3D voronoi cells, and is not optimized for 2D.
  * 2:35pm: moving on the cgal. installing cmake (`brew install cmake`).
  * 3:35pm: ugh cgal is kind of annoying

  * 10.30.15@3:57pm: looking into triangle, making a script to convert the data generated by rbox to format for triangle
  * 6:06pm: just finished up the script (convert_rbox_to_node.py) that takes the point sets generated by rbox and makes them into triangle-consumable .node files.

  * 10.31.15@12:47pm: finshed up scripts to generate a arbitarty number of runs from rbox & cleaned up python script to convert to .node format. going to work on getting hull working.
  * 1:01pm: getting a BUNCH of errors with hull, going to abandon it for now. Getting CGAL again, & thinking about scripts to get the results from all this stuff
  * 3:40pm: scripts to run qhull are working and aggregate results are stashed, now beginning to worry about how all these different libraries implement timing


##### QHull commands 
  * docs: (http://www.qhull.org/html/qvoronoi.htm)
  * `./qhull/bin/qvoronoi Ts s TI <path to datafile >` (note: the dimension in the summary is 1 more than whatever dimension the data file says)
